# Visualizing Trends in Network Communication Over Time

## What is it?
This is a web application visualizing trends in communication between pairs of IP addresses over time. It is built with HTML and JavaScript and Python was used to pre-process PCAP data into a format that the application can ingest.

## Who made it?

## What external libraries/sources does it use?
This application is a fork from a previous project, authored by myself and Athanasios Papadopoulos, which visualized email communications over time. More information on this project can be found by following the link below:
